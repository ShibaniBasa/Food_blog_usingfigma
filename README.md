# Food_blog_usingfigma
## I have created a food blog, where the user need to sign in before accessing it. The user can sign in with any of his/her g-mail email or Facebook id as mentioned in the question. Then after signing in he/she need to verify his/her user id as admin/writer/public. Only Admin, Super Admin, Writer have the access to edit and the Public will only see or read the blog.
